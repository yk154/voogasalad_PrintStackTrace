1. A help page is needed to explain the components of the user interface and the responsibility of each part.
2. Instructions are needed for using the Phase graph and Groovy graph, otherwise the user would not know how to connect the blocks together.
3. There should be instructions on is it allowed to stack two things together. Also, when two things are stacked together, the user could not move or remove either of them.
4. The authoring environment and the game launcher are not connected. They should be integrated so that the user could run the game in the authoring environment.
5. I think the sidebar (where you can drag entities, etc.) should have tooltips to indicate that you can drag it. 
6. Multiple entities can be placed into one grid cell, which is a bug in our program.
7. The tile is supposed to occupy a few grid cells, however the current program is unable to achive this function.
8. The Edit button for the Game Objects is a bit ugly and looks out-of-place.
9. The image, if it is not a sqaure will be resized to fill the whole grid cell, which sometimes distort the image largely.
10. The undo function is not working properly.
